# SongRediscoverer
Welcome to SongRediscoverer! This app uses the Last.fm API to find songs that you listened to at least a given number of times during a given time period, but have listened to no more than a given number of times since that time period to the present. This allows you to rediscover songs that you haven't listend to in a while!
